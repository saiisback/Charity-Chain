# Charity Chain

In the current charitable landscape, transparency and efficiency in donations are significant challenges. Traditional donation systems often lack clear visibility into fund allocation and can be marred by inefficiencies, leading to delays and misuse of funds. Additionally, NGOs and charitable organizations frequently struggle to secure funding and provide employment opportunities due to limited financial resources and administrative overhead.

**Charity Chain aims to address these issues by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain and decentralized technologies. The project seeks to:**

- **Enhance Transparency:** Ensure that donations are traceable and verifiable through smart contracts, reducing the potential for misuse and ensuring that funds are directed to the intended recipients.
- **Improve Efficiency:** Streamline the donation process using blockchain technology, minimizing delays and administrative burdens associated with traditional donation systems.
- **Support NGO Employment:** Provide job opportunities within NGOs by creating a platform that facilitates funding and employment directly through the DApp.
- **Integrate Decentralized Storage:** Utilize Filecoin for secure and decentralized storage of important documents and data related to charitable activities.
- **Offer an NFT Marketplace:** Introduce an optional NFT marketplace to allow donors to contribute to charitable causes through unique digital assets, enhancing engagement and funding opportunities.

## Features

Some of the notable feature provided by our dev application

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language used to write the contracts.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment to compile, test, and deploy smart contracts.
- **Infura**: Ethereum infrastructure provider used to connect to the Ethereum network.
- **MetaMask**: Wallet used to manage private keys and interact with the DApp.
- **Filecoin**: Decentralized storage network to store data.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the front-end user interface.
- **Ethers.js**: Library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
